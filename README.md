# NBodySimulation

This is designed to be a stand alone N-body simulation which can interface with a graphics libray displaying the simulation results in real time.

The TreeGraphics.cc file provides functionality to print the tree structure using my OpenGL-Libs library.

The NSim.h header includes all additional headers.
